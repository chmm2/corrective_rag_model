This repository contains an implementation of an advanced, self-correcting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It leverages the power of **LangGraph** to create a cyclical, state-driven workflow that can dynamically assess document relevance, fall back to web search for off-topic queries, and even rewrite its own questions to improve retrieval accuracy. The entire system is powered by the blazing-fast inference of **Groq** with the **Llama 3** model.

## 🚀 The Problem with Simple RAG

Standard RAG pipelines are powerful but can be brittle. They often fail silently in a few common ways:

-   **Irrelevant Query**: The user's question has nothing to do with the documents, but the RAG system tries to force an answer anyway.
-   **Poor Retrieval**: The vector search returns documents that are not actually helpful for answering the specific question.
-   **Incomplete Answers**: The retrieved context contains only part of the answer, leading to a hallucinatory or incomplete response.

This project implements a **Corrective RAG (CRAG)** architecture to address these issues head-on.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Self-Correction Loop**: If initial documents are irrelevant, the agent rewrites the user's query and tries again.
-   **Dynamic Routing**: The graph first classifies if a question is on-topic. Off-topic questions are routed to a web search tool instead of the document store.
-   **Relevance Grading**: Each retrieved document is individually graded for its relevance to the question, ensuring only high-quality context is passed to the generator.
-   **Stateful Agent**: Built with `LangGraph`, the agent maintains a state (`AgentState`) that tracks the question, documents, grades, and rewrite attempts.
-   **High-Speed Inference**: Uses `ChatGroq` with Llama 3 for near-instantaneous classification, grading, and generation.
-   **Web Search Fallback**: Integrates `DuckDuckGoSearchRun` for questions that are outside the scope of the provided PDF document.

## 🏗️ Architecture Diagram

The agent's logic is defined as a state graph. This graph dictates the flow of information and the decisions the agent makes at each step.

### Workflow Explained

1.  **Topic Decision**: The user's query first enters the `topic_decision` node. A Groq-powered classifier determines if the question is relevant to the general subject matter of the document base.

2.  **Routing**:
    -   If **off-topic**, the query is routed to the `web_search` node, which uses DuckDuckGo to find an answer and then terminates.
    -   If **on-topic**, the query proceeds to the `retrieve_docs` node.

3.  **Retrieval & Grading**:
    -   `retrieve_docs` fetches relevant document chunks from the Pinecone vector store.
    -   `document_grader` assesses each retrieved document.

4.  **Generation or Rewrite**:
    -   The `gen_router` checks the grades. If any document is marked as "Yes" (relevant), the flow moves to `generate_answer`.
    -   If all documents are marked "No", the flow moves to `rewrite_query`.
    -   The `rewriter` reframes the question for better clarity and specificity, then sends it back to `retrieve_docs` for another attempt.

5.  **Final Answer**: The `generate_answer` node synthesizes the verified, relevant documents into a coherent answer for the user.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
You will need API keys for Groq and Pinecone. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add your keys.

***Example `.env` file:***
```dotenv
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key"
```

### 5. Configure Pinecone
The code is configured to use a Pinecone index named `"final-touch"`. Make sure you have created a serverless index with this name in your Pinecone account. The dimension should match the embeddings model (which is **384** for `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).

### 6. Add Your Document
Place the PDF document you want to query in the root directory and name it `new_check.pdf`, or update the filename in the notebook.

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Open the `crag_implement_updates.ipynb` file and run the cells sequentially.

> The first run will:
> - Load the PDF.
> - Split it into chunks.
> - Generate embeddings.
> - Index the documents in your Pinecone vector store.
>
> Subsequent runs will use the already indexed data.

## 📊 Demonstration: Example Walkthroughs

The notebook output showcases the agent's corrective capabilities.

### Example 1: Off-Topic Query → Web Search
When asked a question irrelevant to the PDF content, the agent correctly routes to the web.
- **Query**: `"who is the author of this?"` (when context is poor)
- **Path**: `topic_decision` → `off_topic` → `web_search` → `END`
- **Result**: The agent attempts a web search.
  > *Note: The demo shows a rate-limit error, which is a potential issue with the public DuckDuckGo API.*

### Example 2: Bad Retrieval → Query Rewrite → Success
This is the core of the CRAG pattern. The agent fails, corrects itself, and succeeds.
- **Initial Query**: `"Who all are the referneces of this research paper?"`
- **Step 1**: The retriever fetches documents, but the `document_grader` marks them all as `"No"` because they contain author info, not references.
- **Step 2**: The `gen_router` sends the state to the `rewrite_query` node.
- **Step 3**: The LLM rewrites the query to be more precise:
  - **Rewritten Query**: `"Who are the authors and references cited in this research paper?"`
- **Step 4**: The new query is sent back to `retrieve_docs`. This time, it pulls relevant documents for both authors and references.
- **Step 5**: The `document_grader` marks the new documents as `"Yes"`.
- **Step 6**: The flow proceeds to `generate_answer`, providing a complete, correct response.

This demonstrates the system's resilience and ability to overcome the limitations of basic vector search.
